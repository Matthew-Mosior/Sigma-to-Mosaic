# Sigma-to-Mosaic: File Format Converter from sigma_out.gvector.txt to mosaic.txt

## Introduction

File format converters are essential for a host of data conversion needs, from low level instructions to OS-level file format 
conversions.  This shell script is a format converter used to transform the output of SigmaW (Strain-level Inference of Genomes
from Metagenomic Analysis), sigma_out.gvector.txt, into the format accepted for the Mosaic Community Challenge: Strains ([MOSAIC
Community Challenge: Strains](https://platform.mosaicbiome.com/challenges/1)).
