# Sigma-to-Mosaic: File Format Converter from sigma_out.gvector.txt to mosaic.txt

## Introduction

File format converters are essential for a host of data conversion needs, from low level instructions to OS-level file format 
conversions.  This shell script is a format converter used to transform the output of [SigmaW](http://sigma.omicsbio.org/) (Strain-level Inference of Genomes from Metagenomic Analysis), **sigma_out.gvector.txt**, into the format accepted for the Mosaic Community 
Challenge: Strains ([MOSAIC Community Challenge: Strains](https://platform.mosaicbiome.com/challenges/1)).  

## Usage

This script is very easy to use, it takes **sigma_out.gvector.txt** as command line arguments.  Keep in mind, the Strains community
challenge has four datasets:<br/>
`Simulated_Low_Complexity`<br/>
`Simulated_Medium_Complexity`<br/>
`Simulated_High_Complexity`<br/>
`RealData (Mouse fecal samples)`<br/>
Each of these datasets contains four sets of paired-end sequencing reads, so in reality:<br/>
`Simulated_Low_Complexity`<br/>
`-sim_low_S1_PE1.fq`<br/>
`-sim_low_S1_PE2.fq`<br/>
`-sim_low_S2_PE1.fq`<br/>
`-sim_low_S2_PE2.fq`<br/>
`-sim_low_S3_PE1.fq`<br/>
`-sim_low_S3_PE2.fq`<br/>
`-sim_low_S4_PE1.fq`<br/>
`-sim_low_S4_PE2.fq`<br/>
`Simulated_Medium_Complexity`<br/>
`...`<br/>
`Simulated_High_Complexity`<br/>
`...`<br/>
`RealData (Mouse fecal samples)`<br/>
`...`<br/><br/>
Since each set of paired-end sequencing reads (i.e. sim_low_S1_PE1.fq and sim_low_S1_PE2.fq) are run together to output a 
**single** sigma_out.gvector.txt file, you should be running the script **for each dataset** as follows:<br/>
`sh SigmatoMosaic.sh sigma1_out.gvector.txt sigma2_out.gvector.txt sigma3_out.gvector.txt sigma4_out.gvector.txt`<br/>
**&ast;Since all output files are named sigma_out.gvector.txt, you'll need to rename them so that they are all unique, as shown 
above.**<br/><br/>
If you have sigma_out.gvector.txt files with many identified organisms (lines that start with "**&ast;**"), it may be wise to do 
the following:<br/>
`nohup sh SigmatoMosaic.sh sigma1_out.gvector.txt sigma2_out.gvector.txt sigma3_out.gvector.txt sigma4_out.gvector.txt &`<br/>
This will run the script in the background after you logout (nohup) and puts the process into a subshell (&), which allows you
to continue to work in the current terminal session, and will keep it running once you logout.<br/><br/>
Running SigmatoMosaic.sh will output a single file, **mosaic.txt**.<br/><br/>
Please see example files **sigma_out.gvector.txt** and **mosaic.txt** (examples of input and output). 

## Roadmap 

In the near future, SigmatoMosaic.sh will have:<br/>
-Incorrect file format detection.<br/>
-Placeholder zeros when organism wasn't identified (per file), so relative abundances will be mapped to specific 
sigma_out.gvector.txt input files.
